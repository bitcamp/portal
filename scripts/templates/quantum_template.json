As we're gearing up to start we wanted to gauge interest in The Quantum Track having two different levels: an intro level and advanced level. The introduction level would be suggested for beginner hackers / people who don't have much experience with quantum. On the other hand, the advanced level would have a more open-ended prompt, this level would be suggested for hackers who attended the quantum track last year (Bitcamp 2022) or have experience with quantum.
